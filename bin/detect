JBOSS_HOME is set to an invalid directory: ${JBOSS_HOME}

The JBOSS_HOME environment variable does not point to a valid
WildFly installation directory. Ensure you have an existing
WildFly installation setup before using this buildpack.

The preferred method of installing the WildFly server is with
the Heroku WildFly buildpack. This can be added with the following
commands to your application:

  heroku buildpacks:clear
  heroku buildpacks:add heroku/java
  heroku buildpacks:add mterhart/wildfly
  heroku buildpacks:add mterhart/wildfly-postgresql

The WildFly buildpack is the easiest method of installation, but
you can use other services for installation if necessary.

This buildpack requires the JBOSS_HOME environment variable set
either by the Heroku WildFly buildpack or by a custom config var.
If JBOSS_HOME is not set the buildpack looks for a '.jboss'
directory inside the build directory and sets the environment
variables accordingly if a WildFly installation is found there.

For more information refer to the GitHub repositories of those
buildpacks:

No WildFly installation under '.jboss' directory

If the JBOSS_HOME environment variable is not set this buildpack
expects a WildFly installation under the '.jboss' directory as a
fallback. However, no installation could be found there.

Please ensure you are using either the Heroku WildFly buildpack
or another service to install the WildFly server to the '.jboss'
directory.

You can also explicitly set the JBOSS_HOME variable with a
config var to point to the installation directory:

  heroku config:set JBOSS_HOME=path/to/wildfly-X.X.X.Final
