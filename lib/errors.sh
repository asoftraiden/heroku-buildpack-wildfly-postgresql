The PostgreSQL datasource depends on an existing driver installation.
Please ensure you have the PostgreSQL driver installed. You can also
manually set the name of the driver using the POSTGRESQL_DRIVER_NAME
config var.

PostgreSQL driver is not installed: ${driverName}

The configured driver '${driverName}' is not installed at the WildFly

installing the datasource and that you are using the correct driver
name. You can also manually set the driver name with the
POSTGRESQL_DRIVER_NAME config var.

error_jboss_home_not_set() {
    write_error <<ERROR
JBOSS_HOME not set or not existing

The JBOSS_HOME directory is not set correctly. Verify that you have an
existing WildFly installation under the '.jboss' directory. This can
be done either by the associated Heroku WildFly buildpack or by any
other external service installing a WildFly service to '.jboss'.

The associated buildpack is intended by this buildpack and the preferred
way of installation. For more information refer to the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/mortenterhart/heroku-buildpack-wildfly

An alternative way of setting JBOSS_HOME is to explicitly set a config
var with the path to the WildFly home directory for your application:

  heroku config:set JBOSS_HOME=path/to/wildfly-X.X.X.Final

This setting overrides the location set by this buildpack.
